Messi Performance Data Visualization 🐐
Overview
This project explores and visualizes Lionel Messi’s performance using Python and data visualization libraries. It takes a dataset of his match-by-match stats and creates insightful visual narratives through graphs and metrics that highlight key aspects of his career.

🧪 Technologies Used
Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Pandas / NumPy for data processing

Matplotlib / Seaborn for static plots

Plotly Express (if used) for interactive visualizations

Squarify (if included) for treemap charts

📊 Notebook Features
Data Cleaning & Exploration

Reads and parses CSV data containing goals, assists, minutes played, competition type, etc.

Formats and structures the data for analysis.

Descriptive Statistics

Aggregates total goals, assists, appearances per season and competition.

Computes per-90 metrics (e.g., G+A/90).

Data Visualization

Line plots for season-by-season performance (goals and assists).

Bar charts comparing stats across competitions or clubs.

Treemaps or heatmaps showing contribution by competition or match type (if included).

Trend Analysis

Performance spikes over seasons, efficiency by competition, and key metrics over time.

Visual comparison of Messi’s contributions in high-stakes matches or specific periods.

Narrative Commentary

Markdown insights and cell notes explain patterns like peak performance years or standout matches.

🚀 How to Run

💡 Why This Project Stands Out
Showcases your ability to clean and structure real-world sports data.

Demonstrates effective use of data storytelling through visuals.

Highlights your proficiency in Python data tools.

Builds a clear visual narrative from raw performance data.

🔮 Future Enhancements
Add interactivity using Plotly Dash or Streamlit.

Incorporate advanced stats like Expected Goals (xG).

Publish an HTML/PDF version for easier sharing in portfolios.
